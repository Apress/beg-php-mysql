Dear Reader,

I'd like to thank you for purchasing the book. You've traded hard-earned money for it, and therefore I hope it serves as a valuable reference far into the future.

Enclosed in this zip file are the code examples for "Beginning PHP and MySQL: From Novice to Professional, Fourth Edition". While I've tried to enclose longer listings using listing numbers within the material, making them easy to locate in this package, I realize you may also want to experiment with many of the shorter examples too. Therefore I've included those as well, using a filename that will hopefully help you quickly locate the desired example.

While this code package is intended to ease the tedium and potential for error by providing you with the code found in the book, do not presume all of the examples are going to work out of the box! You may need to change pathnames, SQL parameters, and various other items before certain listings will execute properly.
